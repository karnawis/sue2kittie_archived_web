				<p><i>This product VICTORY for dry and cracked skin has literally changed the way I see my feet. They have never been so tender and soft. Trust me I have tried everything on the market, and have even made numerous trips to the doctor, but there was never a solution. Now, my cracked heals are gone, this cream really works!!! After one week I noticed a dramatic difference and after two weeks they were cured. After two months of not using VICTORY at all my feet are still soft without cracks. For 10 years I suffered the embarrassment of never being able to wear sandals or having my heals exposed. Thank you VICTORY for saving my feet. I recommend this product 100%!!!!</i> Lisa Morgan</p>
				<hr>
				<p><i>Recently started using their cool sculpting machine and I have managed to lose some inches.  Fast and pain free way to lose weight. Flexible hours (open 7 days a week) and reasonable prices. .... Working my way to a hair free place using electrolysis and I'm already seeing results. Microdermabrasion helped even out my skin tone, minimizes pores and made fines lines less visible.</i> Roxanne D.</p>
				<hr>
				<p><i>Skin products (Victory Line) are custom made and all natural.  My sensitive skin does not have any problems with allergic reactions. Thanks.</i> Rosina  Hall</p>
				<hr>
				<p><i>I am very happy that I found a clinic, which provides me with product before and after electrolysis!<br />
				Is a little bit sensitive when I had to do my upper lip. With the cream applied before (30 min) my lip is numb and I feel comfortable during the treatment. After the electrolysis the cream Victory After Electrolysis is calming, soothing and healing NO scabs and redness after the treatment. I can go back to work (I take my appointments in my lunch break)Thanks,</i> Anne Voltaire</p>
				<hr>
				<p><i>I've been going here for electrolysis for a while. It's worked for me and hair is gone permanently from my face. I'm very happy with my results. She also has very low prices compared to other places that charge more for the exact same thing If you've never had it done before I recommend asking her to use it on low first until you get used to it. My friends have also gone here and liked their hair loss results as well. Thanks, </i> Suzanne B</p>
				<hr>
				<p><i>I have a busy schedule and I was very happy that this clinic was so flexible. I had microdermabrasion and a wonderful facial here and will definitely be coming back for regular treatments leading up to my wedding! I have very dry and sensitive skin, so I have to be careful what products I use and prefer to use natural products when I can. Their products feel and smell great and left my face feeling radiant and healthy. The clinic is clean and very comfortable too! Thanks, </i> Michelle R</p>
				<hr>
				<p><i>Had my last treatment a couple weeks ago and I can definitely see  visible differences! My underarm hair is all gone, virtually no more hair there! The bikini zone can still use a few more sessions but you can see that there is a clear decrease in that area. It stings a little tiny bit, but maybe because I have thicker hair. Overall, I think this was well worth it! Thank you kind staff of Bay Street Clinic, I think it's totally worth the investment! Saved me lots in waxing dollars! </i> Gertrud J</p>
				<hr>
				<p><i>It's the New Year and I decided to do something about my (admittedly abundant) neck hair. I've never tried electrolysis but reading online it was supposed to be pretty painful. I've tried waxing before so I figured it can't be too much worse than that.<br/>

				Anyway I showed up and I was uncomfortable about being seen by another patient who was leaving but I guess that's fairly unavoidable given that I'm at a place that does electrolysis.<br />

				I decided to go for 2 hours for my first time and asked for and received a full breakdown of what was going to happen (e.g. how electrolysis works and what I could expect to feel.)<br />

				The woman who performed the treatment took her time with showing me the different heat settings and let me choose the one I thought I could take and then went to work on my neck. She also put on a movie as a distraction, which was at head level and exactly what I wanted.<br />

				So the electrolysis was painful but I chose the high setting but I was impressed that my neck didn't break out after like with waxing and that the instructions I was given to avoid redness (polysporin to start, then hydrocortisone cream to reduce redness) worked perfectly.<br />

				Clean, friendly and effective - exactly what I was looking for. Happy customer. </i><br /> Roger  K</p>
				<hr>
				<p><i>I have been a client for almost 10 years and have never had any problems.  I have very sensitive skin ... think swollen eyes after using Clinique products.. But this clinic uses all natural ingredients that make my skin feel great.  I have also tried many different treatments from microdermabrasion (yes, it takes about 10 treatments to actually have a lasting effect), electrolysis (effects depend on the growth cycle of each hair), skin lightening, facials, and body sculpting.  <br />

				The staff is friendly and they are open 7 days a week, which works for my crazy schedule.  My skin is lighter, clearer and smoother since I have started treatments.  I am also hair free for the areas I have had treated. Thanks. </i><br /> Melisa S</p>
				<hr>
				<p><i>I have unusually dry skin, which has always been a source of embarrassment to me, especially my elbows. Sometimes I try to cover them with long sleeves but you can't do that all the time especially in summer. Then I decided to visit Bay Street Clinic. She sure does know her stuff and their alternative treatment options are quite effective. My skin is much better and is gradually recuperating through the treatments I received here. Thanks,</i>  Lorry  N</p>
				<hr>
				<p><i>I went to Bay Street Clinic for teeth whitening and boy! I got exactly what I wanted. I have a more confident smile and my self-esteem has really soared. Would recommend their services anytime. Thanks,</i>  Albert P</p>
				<hr>
				<p><i>I've been visiting this clinic for several months now for electrolysis for the upper lip, chin, and other parts. I've seen some great results so far.<br /> 

				I was burnt by an IPL system at a reputable spa, where I expected esthetician's to be properly trained. So I am extra careful about who I let near my skin as I do not want another hair removal mishap. <br />

				None of that has happened at Bay St.  Clinic. Victoria takes into account my pain level and the way my skin is reacting to the electrolysis. I really appreciate the flexible hours. Victoria is able to fit me in on weeknights, well after other spas have closed, which is a blessing when it can take 2 hours commute to get back into the city. <br />

				I am happy with my results, and I do recommend others to give Bay St. Clinic a try. Thanks, </i><br /> Singh R.</p>
